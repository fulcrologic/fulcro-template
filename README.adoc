== Status

This is an official template for a Fulcro starter project that might go on to become a production application. It includes a number 
of features that a beginner *will not* need for just playing with the library (full CI test setup, workspaces), but is simple 
enough that a beginner should have no real problem using it.

Beginners should therefore either use this template, or just generate simple play projects from the instructions in
the https://book.fulcrologic.com[Developer's Guide].

Fulcro also has a Rapid Application Development add-on that makes building a production application faster and easier; 
however, a *beginner* should *not* start with RAD except to satisfy surface-level curiosity. RAD requires that you understand
the core library (even though most of it uses convention and configuration over actual code). If you understand Fulcro and are
working on a real production application then you should probably consider using the setup from the
https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-rad-demo[Fulcro RAD demo] as starting point instead of this template. 

RAD gives you a lot of leverage for a new project, and includes a number of pre-written patterns written *in* Fulcro.
It includes very good HTML5 routing, form/report support. It *does not limit* your options, just expands what you have available
by default.

== About This Template

This template includes a server with a mock database and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[CSRF]
protection and a client with login. It also integrates https://github.com/nubank/workspaces/[Nubank Workspaces] for a
visual, interactive development environment for Fulcro components, which you can choose to use.
Both backend Clojure and frontend ClojureScript REPLs are configured and started. There are also sample frontend tests.

The server code leverages https://github.com/tolitius/mount[Mount] to make it easy to start and to reload changes - see
the helper functions in link:https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template/blob/master/src/dev/development.clj[`src/dev/development.clj`].
Client hot code reloading is handled automatically by https://shadow-cljs.org/[shadow-cljs].

The main project source is in `src/main`, the frontend code in `.cljs` files in `+app.*+` and `+app.ui.*+`.

Dependency Aliases:

You will want to enable the `:dev` dependency while developing this project.  In IntelliJ this is in the
"Clojure Deps" border tab window under "Aliases".

== Quick Start

This is a manual to get started with this example project.
It comes with helper `npm run` scripts pre-loaded, you can find them in the package.json file.

Typically you want to start the server and the _main_ and/or _workspaces_ (if you decided to use Nubank Workspaces) client builds. See below. You can simply start everything from the command line

```Shell
git clone --depth 1 -o fulcro-template https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template.git fulcro-app
cd fulcro-app

# The shadow-cljs compiler is a dependency.
yarn install # or: npm install

# 1. Start shadow-cljs frontend compilation server:
npx shadow-cljs server
# 2.: Visit the shadow-cljs compile server UI at http://localhost:9630
#     and enable the "main" and optionally "workspaces" builds
# 3. Start the backend server:
#    (Note: for proper development you will want to start it in a nREPL-based
#     REPL, see the detailed instructions for "The API Server" below.)
clj -A:dev -J-Dtrace -J-Dguardrails.enabled=true
user=> (require 'development)
user=> (in-ns 'development)
development=> (start)
# after modifications of the backend code run: `(restart)`
# 4. Visit the application at http://localhost:3000

# (Optional): Visit the Workspaces UI at http://localhost:3000/wslive.html
# (Optional): Run tests via `npm run client/test` and visit http://localhost:8022
```

=== The shadow-cljs compile server

You can find the UI of the frontend compile server here:
http://localhost:9630
There you can kick off the compilation of the other targets.

=== Connect to the CLJS nREPL:

1. Open and connect your nREPL to localhost:9000.
2. Execute `(shadow/repl :main)`. (you can select another target of course)

=== Backend Clojure nREPL:

The instructions provided above do not start a REPL server for the backend, only a simple
interactive REPL session. See the <<the-api-server,The API Server>> section below to learn
how to start the server from a nREPL REPL that you can connect your editor to.

=== Workspaces

If you choose to use https://github.com/nubank/workspaces[Workspaces], you have two options,
you can run them with the actual backend as described in the Quick Start above
or you can run only the frontend part (communication with the backend will fail due to CSFR):
`npm run client/workspaces` and visit http://localhost:8023

Have a look at `src/workspaces`.

== Detailed instructions

=== Setting Up

The shadow-cljs compiler uses all js dependencies through
NPM. If you use a library that is in cljsjs you will also have to add
it to your `package.json`.

You also cannot compile this project until you install the ones it
depends on already:

```
$ npm install
```

or if you prefer `yarn`:

```
$ yarn install
```

Adding NPM Javascript libraries is as simple as adding them to your
`package.json` file and requiring them! See the
https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_javascript[the Shadow-cljs User's Guide]
for more information.

=== Development Mode

Shadow-cljs handles the client-side development build. The file
`src/main/app/client.cljs` contains the code to start and refresh
the client for hot code reload.

In general it is easiest just to run the compiler in server mode:

```
$ npx shadow-cljs server
INFO: XNIO version 3.3.8.Final
Nov 10, 2018 8:08:23 PM org.xnio.nio.NioXnio <clinit>
INFO: XNIO NIO Implementation Version 3.3.8.Final
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :test available at http://localhost:8022
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :workspaces available at http://localhost:8023
shadow-cljs - server version: 2.7.2
shadow-cljs - server running at http://localhost:9630
shadow-cljs - socket REPL running on port 51936
shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 9000
...
```

then *navigate to the server URL* (shown in this example as http://localhost:9630) and
use the *Builds* menu to enable/disable whichever builds you want watched/running.

Shadow-cljs will also start a web server for any builds that configure one. This
template configures one for workspaces (if running without the Clojure backend is enough for you),
and one for tests:

- Workspaces (without backend): http://localhost:8023
- Workspaces (with the backend; start it first!): http://localhost:3000/wslive.html
- Tests: http://localhost:8022

See the server section below for working on the full-stack app itself.

==== Client REPL

The shadow-cljs compiler starts an nREPL. It is configured to start on
port 9000 (in `shadow-cljs.edn`).

In IntelliJ: add a *remote* Clojure REPL configuration with
host `localhost` and port `9000`.

then:

```
(shadow/repl :main)
```

will connect you to the REPL for a specific build (NOTE: Make sure you have
a browser running the result, or your REPL won't have anything to talk to!)

If you're using CIDER
see https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_cider[the Shadow-cljs User's Guide]
and the comments in `deps.edn` for more information.

==== The API Server

In order to work with your main application you'll want to
start your own server that can also serve your application's API.

Start a https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/repl.html#local-repls[LOCAL clj nREPL in IntelliJ] (using IntelliJ's classpath with
the `dev` https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/deps.html#working-with-aliases[alias selected in the Clojure Deps tab]), or from the command line:

```bash
$ clj -A:dev -J-Dtrace -J-Dguardrails.enabled=true
user=> (require 'development)
development=> (in-ns 'development)
development=> (start)
development=> (stop)
...
development=> (restart) ; stop, reload server code, and go again
development=> (tools-ns/refresh) ; retry code reload if hot server reload fails
```

The `-J-Dtrace` adds a JVM argument that will enable performance tracing for Fulcro Inspect's network tab so you can
see how your resolvers and mutations are performing.

The `-J-Dguardrails.enabled=true` turns on guardrails instrumentation of guardrails spec'd functions, which is a wrapper
of Clojure spec that makes instrumentation and production-time elision (for performance and size) much easier.

NOTE: For real development, please use an editor that has REPL integration, like Cursive (recommended) or
Spacemacs.

The URL to work on your application is then
http://localhost:3000.

Hot code reload, preloads, and such are all coded into the javascript.

==== Preloads

There is a preload file that is used on the development build of the
application `app.development-preload`. You can add code here that
you want to execute before the application initializes in development
mode.

==== Fulcro Inspect

Fulcro inspect will preload on the development build of the main
application and workspaces.  You must install the plugin in Chrome from the
Chrome store (free) to access it.  It will add a Fulcro Inspect tab to the
developer tools pane.

== Tests

Tests are in `src/test`. Any test namespace ending in `-test` will be auto-detected.

```
src/test
└── app
    └── sample_test.cljc          spec runnable by client and server.
```

You can write plain `deftest` in here, and it is preconfigured to support the helper macros in `fulcro-spec` as well.

=== Running tests:


==== Clojure Tests

Typically you'll just run your tests using the editor of choice (e.g. Run tests in namspace in IntelliJ).

The tests are also set up to run with Kaocha at the command line for your convenience and CI tools:

```
$ clj -A:dev:clj-tests --watch
```

See the https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[Kaocha project] for more details.

==== Clojurescript tests

The tests can be run in any number of browsers simply by navigating to the test URL that shadow-cljs outputs.

CI support is done through the `ci-test` build in shadow, and via Karma.

If you start the `ci-tests` build in Shadow-cljs, then you can also run cljs tests in a terminal "watch mode"
with:

```
npx karma start
```

Of course, this make CLJS CI easy:

```
npx shadow-cljs compile ci-tests
npx karma start --single-run
```

==== Running all Tests Once

There is a UNIX Makefile that includes all of the CI commands as the default target. Just run:

```
make
```

== Workspaces

Workspaces is a project by Nubank that is written in Fulcro, and has great support for developing in
Fulcro. It is similar to devcards but has a more powerful user interface, integration with Fulcro Inspect,
and much more.

The source directory for making additions to your workspace is `src/workspaces`.

IMPORTANT: Any namespace ending in `-ws` will be auto-detected and added to your workspace!

== Standalone Runnable Jar (Production, with advanced optimized client js)

See tools deps projects like Depstar. You'll need to make a release js build, optionally
pre-compile your CLJ, and package it.  We will likely add a demo of this process soon.
